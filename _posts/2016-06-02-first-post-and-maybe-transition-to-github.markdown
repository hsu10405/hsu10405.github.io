I am not an avid blogger and hell the last time I updated my blog was three months ago. It's not that I have nothing to post, but half of time when I write them down I feel like that they are not post worthy. Wordpress is decent to use but the neverending updates that might break my blog format and the upcost of renting a dedicated server is pretty darn expensive ($30 dollars a year just for domain registration) for my usage. Now that I know about jekyll this might be my go-to platform since it's a heck lot easier to type in code in 'markdown' than in wordpress. I stil need to figure out what to do with pictures though, maybe I will put them on imgur for now.

{% highlight python %}
def sayHello():
    print("Hello World!")
# All these codes are embedded within markdown.
# No extra arguments needed other than telling markdown when the code starts/ends
{% endhighlight %}

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ZXU4uot.jpg) Markdown format from imgur won't display image by default.
<a href="http://imgur.com/ZXU4uot"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZXU4uot.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
Sample imgur link. Image/album will have to be embedded as html codes.

This should be fun. I am already loving this.
