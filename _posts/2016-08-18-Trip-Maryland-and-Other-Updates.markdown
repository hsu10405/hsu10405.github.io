So my old blog address has expired and the domain is up for grabs, guess this is
the time to move all my materials to here. Oh boy, that's going to to take a
while. \s

All that aside though, I do have some things that I would like to share. 
I designed a 8x8 LED board last year and that is almost done except for
some wiring (fitting everything on a 100x80 mm board is pretty darn tough) and
power consumption issue (I think I am drawing more than 2A here at 5V. I had a 
video of me synthesizing the wires on EagleCAD but I think that is buried in the 
many cycles of reinstalling OS on my computer. As for my Gundam models let's
just say that I have been building couple MG's and will paint them all at once.
It's not my top priority now and I am slowly chugging along when I feel like
building one. 

I decided to spend my week here in Maryland to not only visit my friend Dana from
college but to also visit Balitmore. My piano teacher visited the city before
and she love the place and I was always curious what the place is like. So far
Maryland feels very different. From the borderly tolerable humidity to the
scary thunderstorm last night, so far Maryland is pretty refreshing. No desert,
no dought and a heck ton of trees. As Dana's roommate Xander and I agreed on,
Maryland feels like Arizona with trees.

Time to see what Baltimore is like.
