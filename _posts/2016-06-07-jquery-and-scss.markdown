I spent my last weekend lurking on Codecademy and tried to teach myself how HTML, JQuery and CSS plays together in Jekyll. To be honest it was a lot easier than I thought: JQuery can be loaded within index.html as a line of code. I stronly recommend people to check Codecademy out on these subjects. It has pretty cool examples and it's really easy to pick it up.

I also have setup a cool background image for all pages too, but now I am stuck making the letters legible. Oh well, that is for another day.
